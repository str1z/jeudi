 A game for my computer science class. I went a bit overboard. Made with Phaser 3 along with sweet Typescript.

You can play the game [here with Surge](https://jeudi.surge.sh)

## Note

- This project has no commercial purpose.

- The musics in this game, a school project, are not made by me. If you would like me to remove them, create an issue and I will try my best to remove the them. Thank you.

- The spritesheet is a modified version of [Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii). Credits for 0x72 for this amazing spritesheet.
