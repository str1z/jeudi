A game for my computer science class. I went a bit overboard. Made with Phaser 3 along with sweet Typescript.

You can play the game [here](https://jeudi.weis.studio).

## Game

-   This game is a dungeon game where the objective is to eliminate some monsters to safely bring a lost princess out of the dungeon.
-   The game features a maze generator to generate a dungeon given a seed.
-   There are many power ups in the game that gives your various boosts.

## Note

-   This project has no commercial purpose.
-   The musics in this game, a school project, are not made by me. If you would like me to remove them, create an issue.
-   The spritesheet is a modified version of [Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii). Credits for 0x72 for this amazing spritesheet.
